# ttd-release
This repository will server as the main point for testers to download and
run releases of our game *Thomas the Dentist*.

If you find any bugs or have any questions, please create an issue on this
repository so that we may look into it. 

Once we're ready, we're planning to release the source code, but until then
please download the game and see if you can beat your friends' highest scores :)
