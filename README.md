# The Wrath of Thomas the Dentist
This is our final year game project and is for educational purposes only.

## Where can I find the game?
You can download the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/mcfullard/ttd-release/releases)

## What are the requirements to run a release?
- Multi-platform support for Windows, Linux and Mac as long as you have at least OpenGL v2 (or a proprietary equivalent)
- You need to have [JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) installed

## What do I need to start developing?
- Java IDE (not strictly necessary, but it makes life easier) that has Gradle integration
- Git (that goes without saying)

## Release Notes

###v1.0.3

Fixed issue #2 and other minor changes.

###v1.0.2

After @gnmaritz very kindly pointed out our security loophole, we decided to revert to a build that does not make use of a remote database to track users. We'd definitely like to support that kind of functionality in future, but we just don't have the time to implement it properly right now. Until then you'll just have to play to beat the high scores on your local machine.
