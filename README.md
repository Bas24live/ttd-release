# ttd-release
This repository will serve as the main point for testers to download and
run releases of our game *The Wrath of Thomas the Dentist*.

We're still actively developing so please be patient with us :) If you find any
bugs or have any questions, please create an issue on this repository or contact
me or any of the other developers so that we may look into it.

Once we're ready, we're planning to release the source code, but until then you
can download the game and see if you can beat your friends' highest scores :)

## Requirements
