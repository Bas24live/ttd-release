# The Wrath of Thomas the Dentist
This is our final year game project and is for educational purposes only. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoy making it.
Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mcfullard/ttd-release/issues) to report any bugs, suggestions or questions.

## Where can I find the game?
You can download the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/mcfullard/ttd-release/releases)

## What are the requirements to run a release?
- Multi-platform support for Windows, Linux and Mac as long as you have at least OpenGL v2 (or a proprietary equivalent)
- You need to have [JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) installed

## What do I need to start developing?
- Java IDE (not strictly necessary, but it makes life easier) that has Gradle integration
- Git (that goes without saying)

## What are the licensing issues?
The source code is distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.
