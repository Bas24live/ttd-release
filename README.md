# ttd-release
This repository will serve as the main point for testers to download and
run releases of our game *The Wrath of Thomas the Dentist*.

We're still actively developing so please be patient with us :) If you find any
bugs or have any questions, please create an issue on this repository or contact
me or any of the other developers so that we may look into it.

Once we're ready, we're planning to release the source code, but until then you
can download the game and see if you can beat your friends' highest scores :)

## Requirements
- Windows / Linux / Mac
- [JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

## Release Notes

###v1.0.2
After @gnmaritz very kindly pointed out our security loophole, we decided to revert to a build that does not make use of a remote database to track users. We'd definitely like to support that kind of functionality in future, but we just don't have the time to implement it properly right now. Until then you'll just have to play to beat the high scores on your local machine.
