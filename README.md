#The Wrath of Thomas the Dentist

* Version 0.0.1

##Development Environment Setup
You've made it to the repo! Congratulations. Follow the breadcrumbs...

###Git
* Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* I recommend that you read this quick [tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) on git,
since we'll be using it all the time.

###Import the project
* Open IntelliJ and cancel any automatic project loading.
* Select *Check out from version control* and pick *Git* from the dropdown list.
* Enter `https://bitbucket.org/unobtruse/ttd` into the *Git Repository URL* text box.
* Test the connection and enter your Bitbucket credentials when prompted.
* Change *Parent Directory* to the directory where you'd like the project to live and then click *Clone*.
* If you are prompted to open the project, select *Yes*.
* You should now see a window called *Import Project from Gradle*. Make sure that *Gradle JVM* points to your Java SDK
directory (it should detect it automatically). Select *OK*. Gradle (a build manager) will now go and look for all the
missing dependencies online and download them as needed. This could take quite a bit of time, so don't worry too much.
You should have a consistent internet connection for this step to work properly, else you'll have to run it again.
* Once Gradle has fetched and built everything, your project should open up in IntelliJ.

###Third Party Software
If you're going to be creating graphics and maps you might want to install the following:

* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/download/) --- A vector graphics program
* [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/download.html) --- A map editor

##Scrum and Project Management
Check your email for a link to the SeeNowDo project. I've created sprints for every week of the project. You should
create a *story* for every major use case assigned to you in the planning schedule. Every story should then contain all
the tasks that you'll need to complete for the story to be completed.

I've already created a few stories and tasks in Sprint 1 for myself. You'll notice that I added some that don't have
corresponding use cases; this is because there appears to be quite a lot of work that doesn't fit into a use case.
You should probably do the same thing so that we can all keep track of all the major and minor tasks that need to be
done.

**Please keep track of the sites/URLs you visit when you're doing a task and add those links to the task's notes for
when someone else might need to do some work on a similar task.**
